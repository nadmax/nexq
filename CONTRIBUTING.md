# Contributing

First of all, thank you if you read this file.  
It means for me that you're interested in how to contribute to the project.  

Here's how you can do it:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/nadmax/nexq/fork)
2. Clone your fork
3. Make your changes following the guidelines below
4. Push and open a Pull Request from your fork branch to the master branch

## Guidelines

To maintain a clean, consistent, and maintainable codebase, all contributors are expected to follow these rules:

- **Code must be written in English**  
All variable names, function names, and other identifiers must be in English to ensure clarity and consistency across the codebase.

- **Commits must start with a verb**  
Use imperative, present-tense verbs in commit messages ("Add license", "Update README").

- **Comments are not allowed**
Avoid inline or block comments in the code unless for new Go packages.  
Code should be self-documenting.

- **TODOs are forbidden**  
Do not leave TODO markers in the code.  
Any incomplete features or tasks should be tracked using issues, not comments in the codebase.
